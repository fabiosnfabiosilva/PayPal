# PayPal

This project contains my assessment for the PayPal Solutions Engineering process. 

In the project we can find the following:

- a Node.js-based application containing the APIs, routes and calls to the Sandbox APIs. Instead of Express.js, I've decided to use Fastify for its ease of use and set of functions;
- a Reactjs-based application containing the front end for the assessment;

The communication between the two apps is entirely made by HTTP, using local calls.

Also, it uses the Checkout Advanced Integration combined with SPBs.
